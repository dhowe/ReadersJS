[ **0000 hi Daniel, I'm copying the submission draft into this space now and I'm going to begin to edit it into a 'presentable' form with indication of where demos and readings will come.** ] <br>
[ ** ok - shall we plan to alternate reading paragraphs? it may be difficult to orchestrate an  actual performance, as we dont have a server, or a means of viewing multiple outputs ** ]

Is there an art of reading? Is there, that is, a creative, generative art of reading, as opposed to there being good and artful ways to read? Any difficulties we may have with the acknowledgement that there is (or is not) an art of reading may be attributable to a conventional prejudice that reading is neither creative nor generative; it is merely the practice that we apply – receptively, passively – to the appreciation and interpretation of writing. Contemporary culture and aesthetic practices present us with a number of challenges to such prejudice, including the simple assertion, by artist-curators, that reading is art and its presentation as such (see: Simon Morris’ Reading as Art, Bury Art Museum, 2016, August-November, 2016).

Certain practices of digital language art provide a particular and insightful perspective on this and related questions. If creative and, more especially, generative processes of composition are delegated to algorithmic procedures – as a function of digital language art – this implies, at the very least, that there will be some explicitly described process of reading – the reading in of linguistic inputs from source texts, lexicons, corpora, and so on – before there can be any subsequent writing (or ‘text generation’ as it might otherwise be termed). Such ‘reading (in)’ is designed. It is compositional, artful. It is essential to art in this type of digitally-enabled aesthetic practice, and, indeed, helps to constitute these practices as art.

*The Readers Project*, a collaboration of the presenters, accepts the principles underlying this kind of text generation and takes them further. The Project visualizes algorithmic, alternative processes of reading in situ, often with the text-being-read in place and on hand as such, accessible to conventional, human reading. If The Readers Project’  s visualization of such alternative processes is appreciable aesthetically then *The Readers* exemplify, embody, and/or enact reading as an art of language. Moreover, *The Readers* aesthetics-as-critical-practice expose neglected and overlooked aspects of what reading is, as an essential and  complex practice of language. Finally, Cayley in particular, has been concerned with relating practices of reading to the ontology of language. The Project, from this perspective, operates on the horizons of human reading, where language as such is carried back and forth over thresholds of reading, readability, and linguistic ontology.

#### Original Submission - Dec 22, 2016

We have no trouble with the proposition that writing is art. But is there an art of reading? Is there, that is, a creative, generative art of reading, as opposed to there being good and artful ways to read? Any difficulties we may have with the acknowledgement that there is (or is not) an art of reading may be attributable to a conventional prejudice that reading is neither creative nor generative; it is merely the practice that we apply – receptively, passively – to the appreciation and interpretation of writing. Contemporary culture and aesthetic practices present us with a number of challenges to such prejudice, including the simple assertion, by artist-curators, that reading is art and its presentation as such (see: Simon Morris’ Reading as Art, Bury Art Museum, 2016).

Certain practices of Digital Language Art **[why caps?]** provide a particular and insightful perspective on this and related questions. If creative and, more especially, generative processes of composition are delegated to algorithmic procedures – as a function of Digital Language Art – this implies, at the very least, that there will be some explicitly described process of reading – the reading in of linguistic inputs from source texts, lexicons, corpora, and so on – before there can be any subsequent writing (or ‘text generation’ as it might otherwise be termed). Such ‘reading (in)’ is designed. It is compositional, artful. It is essential to art in this type of digitally-enabled aesthetic practice, and, indeed, helps to constitute these practices as art.

The Readers Project, a collaboration of the presenters, accepts the principles underlying this kind of text generation and takes them further. The Project visualizes algorithmic, alternative processes of reading in situ, often with the text-being-read in place and on hand as such, accessible to conventional, human reading. If The Readers Project’  s visualization of such alternative processes is appreciable aesthetically then The Readers exemplify, embody, and/or enact reading as an art of language. Moreover, The Readers aesthetics-as-critical-practice expose neglected and overlooked aspects of what reading is, as an essential and  complex practice of language. Finally, Cayley in particular, has been concerned with relating practices of reading to the ontology of language.

This paper is a revisitation and revision of the theory and practice at stake in The Readers Project, a significant long-term engagement with Digital Language Art. It coincides with the launch of an online sampler application that allows human readers to configure and explore a number of The Project’s algorithmic Readers.
